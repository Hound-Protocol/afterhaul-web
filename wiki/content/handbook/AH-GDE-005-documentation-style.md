# Documentation Style Guide
## Principles
1. **Write for a newcomer.** Assume they are smart, but new to the project.
2. **Plain English.** Short sentences, active voice, common words. Explain jargon once, or link the [glossary](../glossary.md).
3. **One topic per document.** Link rather than repeat.
4. **Facts with sources.** Research claims carry a source and a confidence: confirmed, likely or unknown.
5. **Honest status.** Say what is not done. "Planned for 0.1" beats silence.

## Structure
- Start with a one-line purpose.
- Headings that say what the section is about.
- Tables for comparisons and lists of facts. Numbered lists for steps.
- Code blocks for commands, exactly as typed.
- End research notes with a **Sources** list.

## Handbook documents
| Type | Code | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Policy | HP-POL-NNN | Rules everyone must follow |
| SOP | HP-SOP-NNN | Step-by-step procedures |
| Guide | HP-GDE-NNN | How-to help for an audience |

Each starts with a title, then one metadata line: `Code · Version · Effective date · Owner department · Audience`. Add its audience and one-line summary to `tools/guides_index.py`, then run `python3 tools/guides_index.py`: it writes `data/guides.json`, and the document appears in the website's Handbook with a PDF. Raise the version when the meaning changes (1.0 → 1.1 for small changes, 2.0 for rewrites).

**Join Discord button:** in a document about the Discord server, put the line `<!-- hp:join-discord -->` under the opening paragraph. The website shows a **Join Discord** button there; GitHub hides the line, and printed copies show the invite address.
